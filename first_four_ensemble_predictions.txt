==========================================================================================
ENSEMBLE MODEL INFORMATION:
• Weighted ensemble of four timeframe-based models:
  - Current (2025): 25% weight - Most recent team performance
  - Recent (2023-2025): 45% weight - Recent trends with performance trajectory analysis
  - Extended (2018-2025): 20% weight - Medium-term historical performance
  - Comprehensive (2003-2025): 10% weight - Long-term historical patterns
• Each model contributes a weighted vote proportional to its confidence
• Model consensus indicates agreement across the four different timeframe models
• Top predictive features: Efficiency Margin, Team Rankings, Offensive/Defensive Efficiency
