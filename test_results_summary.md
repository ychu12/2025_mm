# March Madness Prediction Test Results

## Implementation Verification

We conducted multiple tests to verify our implementation of the March Madness prediction system using Random Forest. Below are the key findings from our tests.

### 1. Data Processing

- Successfully loaded and merged KenPom basketball datasets with different column naming conventions
- Dataset contains 363 teams with comprehensive metrics including efficiency, tempo, defensive/offensive ratings
- Feature creation for team matchups works correctly, generating differentials between team statistics

### 2. Model Performance

#### Custom Random Forest vs. Scikit-learn Implementation

| Metric | Custom RF | Scikit-learn RF | Difference/Ratio |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Accuracy | 0.4367 | 0.9533 | 0.5167 (higher for scikit-learn) |
| Training Time | 0.0005s | 0.0574s | 0.01x (custom is faster) |
| Prediction Time | 0.0459s | 0.0021s | 22.39x (scikit-learn is faster) |

*Note*: There appears to be a significant difference in accuracy between the custom and scikit-learn implementations. This suggests that our custom implementation may need optimization or bug fixes.

#### Top Features for Prediction

The most important features for predicting game outcomes are:

1. RankAdjEM_DIFF (0.5272) - Difference in adjusted efficiency margin ranks
2. AdjEM_DIFF (0.3983) - Difference in adjusted efficiency margins
3. AdjOE_DIFF (0.0200) - Difference in adjusted offensive efficiency
4. AvgHeight_DIFF (0.0145) - Difference in average team height
5. Tempo_DIFF (0.0085) - Difference in pace of play

### 3. Tournament Bracket Simulation

We successfully simulated a complete March Madness bracket with the following results:

#### Tournament Results

**Region Winners:**
- East: Miami FL (Seed #5)
- West: Gonzaga (Seed #1)
- South: Kansas (Seed #1)
- Midwest: UConn (Seed #1)

**Final Four:**
- Miami FL vs Gonzaga
- Kansas vs UConn

**Championship Game:**
- Gonzaga vs Kansas

**Champion:** Kansas (Seed #1)

#### Upset Predictions

Our model identified several potential upsets with high probability:

1. #8 Maryland over #4 Virginia: 0.94 probability
2. #5 Purdue over #1 Duke: 0.94 probability
3. #8 Memphis over #4 Indiana: 0.93 probability
4. #9 Florida Atlantic over #4 Indiana: 0.90 probability
5. #8 Arkansas over #4 Virginia: 0.87 probability

## Conclusion

The March Madness prediction system is functioning correctly, integrating basketball team data and successfully simulating tournament brackets. The model correctly identifies important features like adjusted efficiency margin for predicting game outcomes.

However, there is a noticeable discrepancy between our custom Random Forest implementation and scikit-learn's implementation in terms of accuracy. While our custom implementation is faster for training, it's significantly slower for predictions and has much lower accuracy.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate and fix the accuracy issues in the custom Random Forest implementation
2. Add more data preprocessing steps to improve feature quality
3. Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation
4. Create visualizations for the bracket predictions
5. Fine-tune the model parameters for optimal performance
