MODEL INFORMATION:
• Predictions use both current season (2025) and historical (2022-2025) data
• Current season model weighted more heavily (60% vs 40%)
• Historical model includes team performance trends across seasons
• Random Forest classifier with top features: Efficiency Margin, Team Rankings, Offensive/Defensive Efficiency
• For teams with conflicting model predictions, higher confidence model is preferred
